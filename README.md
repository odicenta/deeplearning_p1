# First Neural Network
This project is based on Udacity Deep Learning Foundations Nanodegree. This is the
first of the projects of the course, and the notebook present here is based on the template
of the first project.

## Objective
To create a Neural Network from the base applying gradient descent and backpropagation

### Disclaimer
Aside from the basic Jupyter notebook template, that can be found at the [deep-learning Learning GitHub] repository,
this is my personal work and should not be used for other purposes except the academic and reference.
